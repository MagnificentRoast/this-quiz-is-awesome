# this-quiz-is-awesome
Welcome to my quiz. This is the latest of a series of challenges that I have been working on for the coding bootcamp. Here you will be taking a quiz to see how much knowledge you have in this subject.

The object of the game is to advance as far as you can get, with as many correct answers as you can. It is timed, so you better think quickly! If you answer correctly!

However, if you answer incorrectly, while the question will advance nonetheless, you will lose 10 seconds...

Each question is worth 10 points. I wish you luck!

If you wish to contact me for any future program or game if you happen upon this source code, or if you have any issues, please don't hesitate to report in the "issues" section. Enjoy!!!
